# Deploy to GitHub Pages

A GitHub Action that builds and deploys a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.

## Notes

## FAQ

### Should you use this Action?

If the Jekyll site you're building doesn't require any external plugins outside of the plugins specified on GitHub Pages' [whitelisted plugins](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-jekyll-plugins/#default-plugins), you don't have to use this action as GitHub should automatically build your Jekyll site.

From [Jekyll's documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/):

> Your site is automatically generated by GitHub Pages when you push your source files. Note that GitHub Pages works equally well for regular HTML content, simply because Jekyll treats files without front matter as static assets. So if you only need to push generated HTML, youâ€™re good to go without any further setup.

As for the "external plugins" portion, here's a quote from the same documentation:

> Note that GitHub Pages runs in `safe` mode and only allows a set of [whitelisted plugins](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-jekyll-plugins/#default-plugins).

Otherwise, if you're using plugins that are not in the list of whitelisted plugins, you may use this GitHub Action to build your Jekyll site.
